# Firefox Profile launcher
If you have multiple Firefox Profiles, this small application will allow you to select which profile to launch with whatever version of Firefox you want. __You cannot launch the same profile in the same installation more than once__

__This currently applies to only64 bit windows installs where the Firefox.exe is located:__
"C:\Program Files\"

You can select different Firefox versions installed with different Firefox profiles. _Launching Developer edition of Firefox with a __"release"__ version Profile might not work as it did not work for me. _This is unpreventable_. _ You can also not launch the same profile more then once per Firefox edition. Meaning that you cannot launch profile1 in release 

Private Browsing is available as well.

This tool will not currently support multiple PC users meaning different users login into the PC due to permissions.

This is an AutoIT application. The source code is available here too and you must install AutoIT and the script editor to compile it. All you need to do is download the zip, then extract the folder and compile with AutoIT all the files are there.
