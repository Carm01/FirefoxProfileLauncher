# FirefoxProfiles
If you have multiple Firefox Profiles in your main profile for any reason, this small application will allow you to select which profile to launch

This currently applies to ONLY 64 bit windows installs where the Firefox.exe is located:
"C:\Program Files\"

You can select Different versions installed with different Firefox profiles. Note that newer profile version might not work with some versions number lower then the version number than the Installation version.

This tool will not currenty support multiple PC users meaning differnt users loggin into the PC due to permissions.

This is an AutoIT application. The source code is available here too and you must install AutoIT and the script editor to compile it. All you need to do is download the zip, then extract the folder and compile with AutoIT all the files are there.
