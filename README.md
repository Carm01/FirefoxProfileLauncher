# Firefox Profile launcher
If you have multiple Firefox Profiles, this small application will allow you to select which profile to launch with whatever version of Firefox you want in a separate window(process)

__This currently applies to only 64 bit windows installs where the Firefox.exe is located:__
"C:\Program Files\"

You can select different Firefox edition installed with different Firefox profiles. _Launching Developer edition of Firefox with a __"release"__ version Profile might not work as it did not work for me._ _This is unpreventable_. 
_You can also not launch the same profile more then once per Firefox edition. Meaning that you cannot launch profile1 in release edition more than once._

___Please note that if you are using the same profile with multiple Firefox edition, I cannot predict how they will interact with each other.___

Private Browsing is available as well.
Minimizing the app will place it in the system tray.

This tool will not currently support multiple PC users meaning different users login into the PC due to permissions.

This is an AutoIT application. The source code is available here too and you must install AutoIT and the script editor to compile it. All you need to do is download the zip, then extract the folder and compile with AutoIT all the files are there.
