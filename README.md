# FirefoxProfiles
If you have multiple Firefox Profiles in your main profile for any reason, this small application will allow you to select which profile to launch

This currently applies to ONLY 64 bit windows installs where the Firefox.exe is located:
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\Firefox.exe"

this tool will not currenty support multiple PC users meaning differnt users loggin into the PC due to permissions
